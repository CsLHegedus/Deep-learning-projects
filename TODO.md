Done:
- go through ztm course regression, classification, conv neural networks
- note out ztm course regression, classification, conv neural networks
- get useful code from  regression, classification, conv neural networks
- go through ztm course transfer learning 4
- note out ztm course transfer learning 4 into an end to end example



In progress:
- get useful code from  transfer learning end to end examples
