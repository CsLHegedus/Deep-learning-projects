I haven't finished the project, still I leave this as example for future uses.

Done:
- go through ztm course regression, classification, conv neural networks 1
- note out ztm course regression, classification, conv neural networks 2 
- get useful code from  regression, classification, conv neural networks 3
- go through ztm course transfer learning 4
- go through ztm course transfer learning 5
- go through ztm course transfer learning 6
- note out ztm course transfer learning 4 
- note out ztm course transfer learning 5
- note out ztm course transfer learning 6
- get useful code from go through ztm course transfer learning 4
- get useful code from ztm course transfer learning 5


In progress:
- get useful code from ztm course transfer learning 6
- note out ztm course transfer learning 7
- note out ztm course transfer learning 7
- get useful code from ztm course transfer learning 7
